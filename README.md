## :information_source: How It Works

- Guest visitor: 
  - can browse information about countries and cities where have salons;
  - can view information about salons and their beauty treatments;
  - can view information about every team in current salon.
- Logged Users:
  - can book appointments using interactive datepicker; 
  - can cancel appointments; 
  - can rate salons for which they had confirmed past appointments.  
- Manager:
  - confirms/declines users' appointments for particular salon.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudinary Setup - optionally

#### Running without it:
You won't get an error for missing Cloudinary Credentials - it is handled by using predefined (already uploaded) image, when Cloudinary configuration is missing. So when you are creating content in admin panel, it will be added but not with the image you have chosen.
#### If you want to actually upload images, you should:

1. Add Cloudinary Credentials in `appsettings.json` in the format:
```json
  "Cloudinary": {
    "CloudName": "",
    "ApiKey": "",
    "ApiSecret": "",
    "EnvironmentVariable": ""
  }
```
2. Update the Cloudinary Setup part of `Startup.cs`'s `ConfigureServices` method as follows:
```csharp
            // Cloudinary Setup
            Cloudinary cloudinary = new Cloudinary(new Account(
                this.configuration["Cloudinary:CloudName"],
                this.configuration["Cloudinary:ApiKey"],
                this.configuration["Cloudinary:ApiSecret"]));
            services.AddSingleton(cloudinary);
```
